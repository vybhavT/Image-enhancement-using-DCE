# Image-enhancement-using-DEC
The project aims to develop an end-to-end deep learning framework that enhances low-light images while preserving important details and minimizing noise artifacts. We plan to design and train a CNN architecture that learns from a large-scale dataset of low-light images and corresponding ground truth images captured under optimal lighting conditions. The network will be trained to map low-light images to their corresponding enhanced versions, capturing the intricate relationships between input and output images. Furthermore, to evaluate the proposed deep learning-based approach, we will conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and compare the results against state-of-the-art low-light image enhancement methods.
