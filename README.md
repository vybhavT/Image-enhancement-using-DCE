# Image-enhancement-using-DEC
The project aims to develop an end-to-end deep learning framework that enhances low-light images while preserving important details and minimizing noise artifacts. We plan to design and train a CNN architecture that learns from a large-scale dataset of low-light images and corresponding ground truth images captured under optimal condition.
